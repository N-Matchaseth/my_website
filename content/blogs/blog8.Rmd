At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.

> make sure you remove `eval=FALSE` from the next chunk of R code-- I have it there so I could knit the document

```{r reshape_GDP_data}

tidy_GDP_data  <-  UN_GDP_data %>% 
  #Reshaping data into tidy format
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:51,
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "value") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "IndicatorName",
              values_from = "value") %>%
  #Tidy column names and values
  mutate_at(vars(4:20), funs(./1e9)) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>% 
  rename(final_consumption_exp = 4,
         household_exp = 5,
         government_exp = 6,
         capital_formation = 7,
         fixed_capital_formation = 8,
         exports = 9,
         imports = 10,
         gdp = 11,
         isic_ab = 12,
         isic_ce = 13,
         isic_d = 14,
         isic_f = 15,
         isic_gh = 16,
         isic_i = 17,
         isic_jp = 18,
         total_value_added = 19,
         inventory_changes = 20) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:20, names_to = "IndicatorName", values_to = "values")

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
```

First, can you produce this plot?


```{r gdp1, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)

#Filtering relevant variables
filter_tidy <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
filter(
  Country %in% country_list, 
  IndicatorName %in% c("household_exp", "government_exp", "capital_formation", "exports", "imports"))
  
#Plotting the first chart
gdp_components <- ggplot(filter_tidy, aes(x = year, y = values, colour = IndicatorName)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ Country) +
  labs(title = "GDP components over time",
       subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD",
        x = "",
        y = "Billion US$", 
        colour = "Components of GDP") +
    theme_bw() +
  NULL
  
  gdp_components
  
```


Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

The % difference varies across time and countries, as shown in the 3rd graph below. The largest % difference is reached by India which has up to 8% difference. And the smallest % difference is Germany, which hasn't reached more than 4% difference.


```{r gdp2, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)

tidy_GDP_data2 <- UN_GDP_data %>% 
  #Reshaping data into tidy format
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:51,
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "value") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "IndicatorName",
              values_from = "value") %>%
  #Tidy column names & turning values into proportions
  rename(final_consumption_exp = 4,
         C = 5,
         G = 6,
         I = 7,
         fixed_capital_formation = 8,
         X = 9,
         M = 10,
         gdp = 11) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year),
         gdp_calc = C+G+I+(X-M),
         household_exp = C/gdp,
         govt_exp = G/gdp,
         capital_formation = I/gdp,
         net_exports = (X-M)/gdp,
         gdp_prop = gdp_calc/gdp) %>% 
  select(1:3,22:26) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:8, names_to = "IndicatorName", values_to = "proportion")

#Filtering relevant variables
filter_tidy2 <- tidy_GDP_data2 %>%

         IndicatorName %in% c("household_exp", "govt_exp", "capital_formation", "net_exports"))

#Plotting the second graph

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

The chart illustrates the evolution over time of GDP components as a % of total GDP. We can notice that while the US has known some small changes, India has experienced large shifts in some of its components.

India has seen a boom in its gross capital formation illustrating large inflows of capital that came in the Indian economy. The share of its household expenditure declined. This decline is relative to GDP so it is likely that Indian GDP increased highly while household expenditure stagnated.

Germany has considerably increased the share of its Net exports, illustrating the success of the German manufacturing industry.

The US has increased its share of household expenditure and Gross capital formation, while its Net Exports and Government expenditures decreased. Illustrating the liberalization of the US economy and how it relies on its internal consumption.
