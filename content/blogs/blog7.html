<h2>How are the existing bike trends affected by the pandemic?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/number-bicycle-hires">TfL data</a> shows how many Santander bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following:</p>

<p>Here, I created a facet grid to visualize the number of bikes hired by month and year, from 2015-2020. The blue line shows the monthly average from 2015-2019.</p>

  ungroup()

  mutate(excess_hires = actual_hires - expected_hires) %&gt;% 
  mutate(excess_pos = ifelse(excess_hires &gt;= 0, actual_hires, expected_hires)) %&gt;%  
    mutate(excess_neg = ifelse(excess_hires &lt; 0, actual_hires, expected_hires)) %&gt;%  
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y =expected_hires, group = 1, fill = excess_hires)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y=sum, geom=&quot;line&quot;, color = &quot;darkblue&quot;, size = 1) + 
  geom_line(aes(month, actual_hires), color = &quot;black&quot;, size = 0.1, alpha = 0.5)+

<p>Next, I created a second graph that looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals.</p>
<p>I used mean to calculate the expected rentals here, but median is usually used when there are many outliers. In this data I didnâ€™t notice many of them. Finally, I compare that week/month of 2020 to the expected rentals.</p>

<p>There seems to be a lot of deviation from the expected monthly rentals in 2020, signifying the Covid-19 impact on bike sharing. Whether there is a long-term effect, however, is yet to be determined.</p>
