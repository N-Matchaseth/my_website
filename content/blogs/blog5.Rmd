# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. Make sure you have installed the `fivethirtyeight` package before proceeding.


```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)


# or download directly
# alcohol_direct <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")

```


What are the variable types? Any missing values we should worry about? 

```{r glimpse_skim_data}
# Glimpse at data
glimpse(drinks)

```


Make a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}
# Bar chart of Top 25 Beer countries

beer_top25 <- drinks %>% 
arrange(desc(beer_servings)) %>% 
head(25)

beer_plot <- ggplot(beer_top25, aes(y=reorder(country,beer_servings),x=beer_servings)) + 
geom_col()+ 
labs(title = "Top 25 beer consuming countries",
x= "Beer consumption (servings)",
y= "Countries") +
NULL

beer_plot
```

Make a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}

# Bar chart of Top 25 Wine countries
wine_top25 <- drinks %>% 
arrange(desc(wine_servings)) %>% 
head(25)

wine_plot <- ggplot(wine_top25, aes(y=reorder(country,wine_servings),x=wine_servings)) + 
geom_col()+ 
labs(title = "Top 25 wine consuming countries",
x= "Wine consumption (servings)",
y= "Countries") +
NULL

wine_plot

```

Finally, make a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries
```{r spirit_plot}
# Bar chart of Top 25 Spirits countries
spirits_top25 <- drinks %>% 
arrange(desc(spirit_servings)) %>% 
head(25)

spirits_plot <- ggplot(spirits_top25, aes(y=reorder(country,spirit_servings),x=spirit_servings)) + 
geom_col()+ 
labs(title = "Top 25 spirits consuming countries",
x= "Spirits consumption (servings)",
y= "Countries") +
NULL

spirits_plot

```

What can you infer from these plots? Don't just explain what's in the graph, but speculate or tell a short story (1-2 paragraphs max).

For beer servings, it is unexpected

Bigger range in spirits compared to wine & beer
Continental/regional differences between the 3 alcohol consumption
There is a relationship between wine consuming and wine producing countries, wine producers in top 25 consumption
High income countries tend to consume wine, while lower income countries consume more of beer and spirits (cheaper? more available?)
