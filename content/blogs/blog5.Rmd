## Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alcohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. I installed the `fivethirtyeight` package before proceeding further.


```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)


# or download directly
# alcohol_direct <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")

```

Firstly, I used `glimpse` to briefly look into variable types

```{r glimpse_skim_data}
# Glimpse at data
glimpse(drinks)

```


Then, I made a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}
# Bar chart of Top 25 Beer countries

beer_top25 <- drinks %>% 
arrange(desc(beer_servings)) %>% 
head(25)

beer_plot <- ggplot(beer_top25, aes(y=reorder(country,beer_servings),x=beer_servings)) + 
geom_col(fill = "#FFD355")+ 
labs(title = "Top 25 beer consuming countries",
x= "Beer consumption (servings)",
y= "Countries") +
NULL

beer_plot
```

Next, a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}

# Bar chart of Top 25 Wine countries
wine_top25 <- drinks %>% 
arrange(desc(wine_servings)) %>% 
head(25)

wine_plot <- ggplot(wine_top25, aes(y=reorder(country,wine_servings),x=wine_servings)) + 
geom_col(fill = "#b11226")+ 
labs(title = "Top 25 wine consuming countries",
x= "Wine consumption (servings)",
y= "Countries") +
NULL

wine_plot

```

Finally, a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries

```{r spirit_plot}
# Bar chart of Top 25 Spirits countries
spirits_top25 <- drinks %>% 
arrange(desc(spirit_servings)) %>% 
head(25)

spirits_plot <- ggplot(spirits_top25, aes(y=reorder(country,spirit_servings),x=spirit_servings)) + 
geom_col()+ 
labs(title = "Top 25 spirits consuming countries",
x= "Spirits consumption (servings)",
y= "Countries") +
NULL

spirits_plot

```

You can see from the Top 25 spirits chart that Thailand, my home country, is there! We do consume a lot of spirits.

In general, the results for these graphs show that:

* Bigger consumption range in spirits compared to wine & beer
* There are continental/regional differences between the 3 alcohol consumption
* There is a relationship between wine consuming and wine producing countries, wine producers (eg. France) in top 25 consumption
* High income countries tend to consume wine, while lower income countries consume more of beer and spirits (perhaps cheaper? or more available?)
