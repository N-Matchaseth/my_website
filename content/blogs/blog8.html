<div id="how-has-the-main-components-of-gdp-changed" class="section level2">
<h2>How has the main components of GDP changed?</h2>
<p>From my economics class, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports).</p>
<p>The GDP data we will look at is from the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads">United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database</a>, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country’s GDP.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>UN_GDP_data  &lt;-  read_excel(here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls&quot;), # Excel filename

<p>Firstly, I tidied the data by converting it from a wide into long tidy format. I also express all figures in billions, as well as renaming the indicators.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tidy_GDP_data  &lt;-  UN_GDP_data %&gt;%

               values_to = &quot;value&quot;) %&gt;% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = &quot;IndicatorName&quot;,
              values_from = &quot;value&quot;) %&gt;%
  #Tidy column names and values
  mutate_at(vars(4:20), funs(./1e9)) %&gt;% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %&gt;% 
  rename(final_consumption_exp = 4,
         household_exp = 5,
         government_exp = 6,
         capital_formation = 7,

         exports = 9,
         imports = 10,
         gdp = 11,
         isic_ab = 12,
         isic_ce = 13,
         isic_d = 14,
         isic_f = 15,
         isic_gh = 16,

         isic_jp = 18,
         total_value_added = 19,
         inventory_changes = 20) %&gt;% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:20, names_to = &quot;IndicatorName&quot;, values_to = &quot;values&quot;)

<p>Next, I visualized the changes in the main GDP components over time for 3 different countries (USA, India and Germany).</p>

<p>Secondly, I looked at the main components of GDP of Household Expenditure (Consumption <em>C</em>), Gross Capital Formation (business investment <em>I</em>), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports), and visualize it as a percentage of total GDP.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tidy_GDP_data2 &lt;- UN_GDP_data %&gt;%

               values_to = &quot;value&quot;) %&gt;%

  rename(final_consumption_exp = 4,
         C = 5,

         I = 7,
         fixed_capital_formation = 8,
         X = 9,
         M = 10,
         gdp = 11) %&gt;% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year),
         gdp_calc = C+G+I+(X-M),
         household_exp = C/gdp,
         govt_exp = G/gdp,
         capital_formation = I/gdp,
         net_exports = (X-M)/gdp,
         gdp_prop = gdp_calc/gdp) %&gt;%

  pivot_longer(cols = 4:8, names_to = &quot;IndicatorName&quot;, values_to = &quot;proportion&quot;)

  filter(Country %in% country_list,

<p>The chart illustrates the evolution over time of GDP components as a % of total GDP. We can notice that while the US has known some small changes, India has experienced large shifts in some of its components.</p>
<p>India has seen a boom in its gross capital formation illustrating large inflows of capital that came in the Indian economy. The share of its household expenditure declined. This decline is relative to GDP so it is likely that Indian GDP increased highly while household expenditure stagnated.</p>
<p>Germany has considerably increased the share of its Net exports, illustrating the success of the German manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>The US has increased its share of household expenditure and Gross capital formation, while its Net Exports and Government expenditures decreased. Illustrating the liberalization of the US economy and how it relies on its internal consumption.</p>
<p>Lastly, we compared the GDP calculated from the main components with actual GDP that is given by the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Comparing calculated GDP to GDP that is given

<p>The % difference varies across time and countries, as shown in the 3rd graph below. The largest % difference is reached by India which has up to 8% difference. And the smallest % difference is Germany, which hasn’t reached more than 4% difference.</p>
