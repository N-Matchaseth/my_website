# Rentals in TfL bike sharing

The [TfL data](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/number-bicycle-hires) shows how many Santander bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following:

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```

Here, I created a facet grid to visualize the number of bikes hired by month and year, from 2015-2020. The blue line shows the monthly average from 2015-2019.

```{r, out.width="100%"}
#First graph

bikes_exp <- bike %>% 
  filter(year >= 2015 & year <= 2019) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(expected_hires = mean(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  ungroup()

  bike %>% 
  filter(year >= 2015 & year <= 2020) %>% 
  group_by(month, year) %>% 
  summarise(actual_hires = mean(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  left_join(bikes_exp, by = "month") %>% 
  mutate(excess_hires = actual_hires - expected_hires) %>% 
  mutate(excess_pos = ifelse(excess_hires >= 0, actual_hires, expected_hires)) %>%  
    mutate(excess_neg = ifelse(excess_hires < 0, actual_hires, expected_hires)) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y =expected_hires, group = 1, fill = excess_hires)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y=sum, geom="line", color = "darkblue", size = 1) + 
  geom_line(aes(month, actual_hires), color = "black", size = 0.1, alpha = 0.5)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = excess_neg , ymax = expected_hires), fill = "#E77471", alpha = 0.8) +
      geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = expected_hires , ymax = excess_pos), fill = "#90EE90", alpha = 0.8) +
#  scale_fill_manual(values=c("green", "red"), name = "fill") +
  facet_wrap(~ year) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(
    y = "Bikes Rentals",
    x = "", 
    title = "Monthly Changes in TFL Bike Rentals", 
    subtitle = "Change form monthly average shown in blue \nand calculated between 2015-2019"
    
  ) + 
    
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12, face = "bold"), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10), 
          axis.text.x = element_text(hjust=1, size = 6))

```

Next, I created a second graph that looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals.

I used mean to calculate the expected rentals here, but median is usually used when there are many outliers. In this data I didn't notice many of them. Finally, I compare that week/month of 2020 to the expected rentals.

```{r}
#Second graph

bikes_exp <- bike %>% 
  filter(year >= 2015 & year <= 2019) %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(expected_hires = mean(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  ungroup()

  bike %>% 
  filter(year >= 2015 & year <= 2020) %>% 
  group_by(week, year) %>% 
  summarise(actual_hires = mean(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  left_join(bikes_exp, by = "week") %>% 
  mutate(excess_hires = (actual_hires - expected_hires)/expected_hires) %>% 
  mutate(group = ifelse(excess_hires > 0, "Postive", "Negative")) %>% 
  mutate(excess_pos = ifelse(excess_hires >= 0, actual_hires, expected_hires)) %>%  
  mutate(excess_neg = ifelse(excess_hires < 0, actual_hires, expected_hires)) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x=week, y= excess_hires)) +
  geom_area(alpha=0.4, fill = "#90EE90", alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = ifelse(excess_hires > 0,0, excess_hires), ymax =0 ), fill = "#E77471", alpha = 0.8) + 
  geom_line(color="#696969", size=0.15) +
  geom_rug(sides = "b", aes(color = group, show.legend = FALSE)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#90EE90', '#E77471')) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(x*100, "%")) + 
  facet_wrap(~ year)+
  theme_bw() + 
      labs(
    y = "Bikes Rentals",
    x = "", 
    title = "Weekly Changes in TFL Bike Rentals", 
    subtitle = "Change form mweekly averages \ncalculated between 2015-2019"
    
  ) + 
    
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12, face = "bold"), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10), 
          axis.text.x = element_text(hjust=1, size = 10), legend.position = "none")

```

There seems to be a lot of deviation from the expected monthly rentals in 2020, signifying the Covid-19 impact on bike sharing. Whether there is a long-term effect, however, is yet to be determined.
