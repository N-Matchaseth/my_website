# Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r, out.width="100%"}
#First graph

bikes_exp <- bike %>% 
  filter(year >= 2015 & year <= 2019) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(expected_hires = mean(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  ungroup()

  bike %>% 
  filter(year >= 2015 & year <= 2020) %>% 
  group_by(month, year) %>% 
  summarise(actual_hires = mean(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  left_join(bikes_exp, by = "month") %>% 
  mutate(excess_hires = actual_hires - expected_hires) %>% 
  mutate(excess_pos = ifelse(excess_hires >= 0, actual_hires, expected_hires)) %>%  
    mutate(excess_neg = ifelse(excess_hires < 0, actual_hires, expected_hires)) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y =expected_hires, group = 1, fill = excess_hires)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y=sum, geom="line", color = "darkblue", size = 0.3) + 
  geom_line(aes(month, actual_hires), color = "black", size = 0.1, alpha = 0.5)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = excess_neg , ymax = expected_hires), fill = "#E77471", alpha = 0.8) +

  ) + 
    
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12, face = "bold"), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10), 
          axis.text.x = element_text(hjust=1, size = 6))

```

```{r}
#Second graph

  filter(year >= 2015 & year <= 2019) %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(expected_hires = mean(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  ungroup()

  bike %>% 
  filter(year >= 2015 & year <= 2020) %>% 
  group_by(week, year) %>% 
  summarise(actual_hires = mean(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  left_join(bikes_exp, by = "week") %>%

  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(x*100, "%")) + 
  facet_wrap(~ year)+
  theme_bw() + 
      labs(
    y = "Bikes Rentals",
    x = "", 
    title = "Weekly Changes in TFL Bike Rentals", 
    subtitle = "Change form mweekly averages \ncalculated between 2015-2019"
    
  ) + 
    
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12, face = "bold"), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10), 
          axis.text.x = element_text(hjust=1, size = 10), legend.position = "none")

```


For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2015-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?
>I used mean here, but median is usually used when there are many outliers. In this data I didn't notice many of them.
