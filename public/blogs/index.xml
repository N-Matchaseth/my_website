      <description>Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?Back in 2014, fivethiryeight.com published an article on alcohol consumption in different countries. The data drinks is available as part of the fivethirtyeight package. I installed the fivethirtyeight package before proceeding further.
library(fivethirtyeight)data(drinks)# or download directly# alcohol_direct &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv&amp;quot;)Firstly, I used glimpse to briefly look into variable types

      <description>The objective of this project is to produce a plot that shows the top ten cities in highest amounts raised in political contributions in California during the 2016 US Presidential election, for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
First of all, I have to join two dataframes; the data on all contributions, and data that can translate zipcodes to cities.
# Make sure you use vroom() as it is significantly faster than read.</description>

      <description>How has the main components of GDP changed?From my economics class, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports).
The GDP data we will look at is from the United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country’s GDP.</description>
