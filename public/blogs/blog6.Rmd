The objective of this project is to produce a plot that shows the top ten cities in highest amounts raised in political contributions in California during the 2016 US Presidential election, for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

First of all, I have to join two dataframes; the data on all contributions, and data that can translate [zipcodes](http://www.uszipcodelist.com/download.html) to cities.

```{r, load_CA_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Make sure you use vroom() as it is significantly faster than read.csv()
CA_contributors_2016 <- vroom::vroom(here::here("data","CA_contributors_2016.csv"))
zip_code <- vroom::vroom(here::here("data","zip_code_database.csv"))

glimpse(CA_contributors_2016)
glimpse(zip_code)

merge_table <- merge(
  CA_contributors_2016, zip_code,
  by=c("zip")
)

glimpse(merge_table)

```

For the visualization, I followed the method suggested by Julia Silge's post on [REORDERING AND FACETTING FOR GGPLOT2](https://juliasilge.com/blog/reorder-within/) in order to reorder within candidate category.

```{r,hillary_trump, out.width="100%"}
# Creating dataset for Top 10 cities by contributions for Hillary and Trump
hillary_trump <- merge_table %>% 
  group_by(primary_city, cand_nm) %>% 
  summarize(total=sum(contb_receipt_amt)) %>% # sum of contribution in each cities for each candidate
  filter(cand_nm %in% c("Trump, Donald J.","Clinton, Hillary Rodham")) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>% 
  group_by(cand_nm) %>% 
  slice_head(n=10) # selecting top 10 cities, by candidate

# Prepping for ggplot using tidytext for reordering
library(tidytext)
hillary_trump <- hillary_trump %>% 
  mutate(primary_city = reorder_within(primary_city,total,cand_nm))

# ggplots for Top 10 contribution cities bar chart
cont_plot <- ggplot(hillary_trump, aes(x=total, y=primary_city, fill=cand_nm)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", show.legend = FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~cand_nm, scales = c("free")) +
  scale_y_reordered() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Blue","Red")) +
  labs(title = "Where did candidates raised most money?",
       x = "Amount raised",
       y = NULL)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size=8),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size=8))+
  NULL

cont_plot
```

In terms of sheer amount of contribution, Hillary received a lot more than Trump did from cities in California, although mostly concentrated in LA and SF. This is to be expected, as California has traditionally been a Democratic stronghold in presidential elections. I wonder if there will be any changes to these contribution levels in the upcoming presidential election in 2020!
